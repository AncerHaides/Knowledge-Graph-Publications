- **abstract**:In sequence labeling, previous domain adaptation methods focus on the adaptation from the source domain to the entire target domain without considering the diversity of individual target domain samples, which may lead to negative transfer results for certain samples. Besides, an important characteristic of sequence labeling tasks is that different elements within a given sample may also have diverse domain relevance,which requires further consideration. To take the multi-level domain relevance discrepancy into account, in this paper, we propose a ﬁne-grained knowledge fusion model with the domain relevance modeling scheme to control the balance between learning from the target domain data and learning from the source domain model. Experiments on three sequence labeling tasks show that our ﬁne-grained knowledge fusion model outperforms strong baselines and other state of-the-art sequence labeling domain adaptation methods.
