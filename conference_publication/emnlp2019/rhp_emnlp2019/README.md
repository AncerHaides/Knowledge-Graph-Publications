# Fine-Grained Evaluation for Entity Linking

- **author**:Henry Rosales-Mendez,Aidan Hogan,Barbara Poblete 

- **abstract**:The Entity Linking (EL) task identiﬁes entity mentions in a text corpus and associates them with an unambiguous identiﬁer in a Knowledge Base. While much work has been done on the topic, we ﬁrst present the results of a survey that reveal a lack of consensus in the community regarding what forms of mentions in a text and what forms of links the EL task should consider. We argue that no one deﬁnition of the Entity Linking task ﬁts all, and rather propose a ﬁne-grained categorization of different types of entity mentions and links. We then re-annotate three EL benchmark datasets–ACE2004,KORE50, and VoxEL – with respect to these categories. We propose a fuzzy recall metric to address the lack of consensus and conclude with ﬁne grained evaluation results comparing a selection of online EL systems.
