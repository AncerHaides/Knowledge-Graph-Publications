# Zero-Shot Question Generation from Knowledge Graphs for Unseen Predicates and Entity Types
* **author**: Hady Elsahar, Christophe Gravier, Frederique Laforest
* **abstract**: We present a neural model for question generation from knowledge graphs triples in a “Zero-shot” setup, that is generating questions for predicate, subject types or object types that were not seen at training time. Our model leverages triples occurrences in the natural language corpus in a encoder-decoder architecture, paired with an original part-of-speech copy action mechanism to generate questions. Benchmark and human evaluation show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art on this task.
