- **abstract**:Knowledge graphs have become ubiquitous data sources and their utility has been amplified by the research on ability to answer carefully crafted questions over knowledge graphs. We investigate the problem of question generation (QG) over knowledge graphs wherein, the level of difficulty of the question can be controlled. We present an end-to-end neural network-based method for automatic generation of complex multi-hop questions over knowledge graphs. Taking a subgraph and an answer as input, our transformer-based model generates a natural language question. Our model incorporates difficulty estimation based on named entity popularity, and makes use of this estimation to generate difficulty-controllable questions. We evaluate our model on two recent multi-hop QA datasets. Our evaluation shows that our model is able to generate high-quality, fluent and relevant questions.
