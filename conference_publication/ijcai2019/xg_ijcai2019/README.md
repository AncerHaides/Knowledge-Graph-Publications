# Entity Alignment for Cross-lingual Knowledge Graph with Graph Convolutional Networks

- **author**:Fan Xiong, Jianliang Gao

- **abstract**:Graph convolutional network (GCN) is a promising approach that has recently been used to resolve knowledge graph alignment. In this paper, we propose a new method to entity alignment for cross-lingual knowledge graph. In the method, we design a scheme of attribute embedding for GCN training. Furthermore, GCN model utilizes the attribute embedding and structure embedding to abstract graph features simultaneously. Our preliminary experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art GCN-based method.
