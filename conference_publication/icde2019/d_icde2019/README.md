* **author**: Xin Luna Dong
* **abstract**: A knowledge graph (KG) describes entities and relations between them; for example, between entities Amazon and Seattle, there can be a headquarter_located_at relation. Recent years have witnessed broad applications of KG in search (e.g., by Google and Bing) and question answering (e.g., by Amazon Alexa or Google Home). In this talk, we ask the question: Can one build a knowledge graph (KG) for all products in the world?
