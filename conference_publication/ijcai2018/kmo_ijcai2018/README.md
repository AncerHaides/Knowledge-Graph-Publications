# Attributed Description Logics: Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs
* **author**：Markus Krötzsch, Maximilian Marx, Ana Ozaki, Veronika Thost
* **abstract**: In modelling real-world knowledge, there often arises a need to represent and reason with meta-knowledge. To equip description logics (DLs) for dealing with such ontologies, we enrich DL concepts and roles with finite sets of attribute–value pairs, called annotations, and allow concept inclusions to express constraints on annotations. We investigate a range of DLs starting from the lightweight description logic EL, covering the prototypical ALCH, and extending to the very expressive SROIQ, the DL underlying OWL 2 DL.
