## Integrating Transformer and Paraphrase Rules for Sentence Simplification

**author**:Sanqiang Zhao, Rui Meng, Daqing He, Saptono Andi, Parmanto Bambang

**abstract**:Sentence simplification aims to reduce the
complexity of a sentence while retaining its original meaning. Current models for sentence simplification adopted ideas from machine translation studies and implicitly learned simplification mapping rules from normalsimple sentence pairs. In this paper, we explore a novel model based on a multi-layer and multi-head attention architecture and we propose two innovative approaches to integrate the Simple PPDB (A Paraphrase Database for Simplification), an external paraphrase
knowledge base for simplification that covers a wide range of real-world simplification rules. The experiments show that the integration provides two major benefits: (1) the integrated model outperforms multiple stateof-the-art baseline models for sentence simplification in the literature (2) through analysis of the rule utilization, the model seeks to select more   simplification rules.
