## A State-transition Framework to Answer Complex Questions over Knowledge Base

**author**:Sen Hu, Lei Zou, Xinbo Zhang

**abstract**:Although natural language question answering over knowledge graphs have been studied
in the literature, existing methods have some
limitations in answering complex questions. To address that, in this paper, we propose a State Transition-based approach to translate a complex natural language question N to a semantic query graph (SQG) QS, which is
used to match the underlying knowledge graph to find the answers to question N. In order to generate QS, we propose four primitive operations (expand, fold, connect and merge) and a learning-based state transition approach. Extensive experiments on several
benchmarks (such as QALD, WebQuestions and ComplexQuestions) with two knowledge bases (DBpedia and Freebase) confirm the superiority of our approach compared with stateof-the-arts.
