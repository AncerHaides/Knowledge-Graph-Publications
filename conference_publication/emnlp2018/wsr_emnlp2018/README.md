## Learning Neural Templates for Text Generation

**author**:Sam Wiseman, Stuart M. Shieber, Alexander M. Rush

**abstract**:While neural, encoder-decoder models have
had significant empirical success in text generation, there remain several unaddressed problems with this style of generation. Encoderdecoder models are largely (a) uninterpretable, and (b) difficult to control in terms of their phrasing or content. This work proposes a neural generation system using a hidden semimarkov model (HSMM) decoder, which learns latent, discrete templates jointly with learning to generate. We show that this model learns useful templates, and that these templates make generation both more interpretable and
controllable. Furthermore, we show that this approach scales to real data sets and achieves strong performance nearing that of encoderdecoder text generation models.
