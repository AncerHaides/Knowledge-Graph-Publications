## Knowledge Base Question Answering via Encoding of Complex Query Graphs
**author**:Kangqi Luo, Fengli Lin, Xusheng Luo, Kenny Q.Zhu

**abstract**:Answering complex questions that involve
multiple entities and multiple relations using a standard knowledge base is an open and challenging task. Most existing KBQA approaches focus on simpler questions and do not work very well on complex questions because they were not able to simultaneously
represent the question and the corresponding complex query structure. In this work, we encode such complex query structure into a uniform vector representation, and thus successfully capture the interactions between individual semantic components within a complex question. This approach consistently outperforms existing methods on complex questions while staying competitive on simple questions.
