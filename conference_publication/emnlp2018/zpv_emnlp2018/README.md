**abstract**:We propose an end-to-end deep learning
model for translating free-form natural language instructions to a high-level plan for behavioral robot navigation. The proposed model uses attention mechanisms to connect information from user instructions with a topological representation of the environment. To evaluate this model, we collected a new dataset for the translation problem containing 11,051
pairs of user instructions and navigation plans.
Our results show that the proposed model outperforms baseline approaches on the new dataset. Overall, our work suggests that a topological map of the environment can serve as a relevant knowledge base for translating
natural language instructions into a sequence of navigation behaviors.
