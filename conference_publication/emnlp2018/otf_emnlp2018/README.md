## Event Detection with Neural Networks: A Rigorous Empirical Evaluation

**author**:J.Walker Orr,Prasad Tadepalli,Xiaoli Fern

**abstract**:Detecting events and classifying them into predefined types is an important step in knowledge extraction from natural language texts. While the neural network models have generally led the state-of-the-art, the differences in performance between different architectures have not been rigorously studied. In this paper we present a novel GRU-based
model that combines syntactic information along with temporal structure through an attention mechanism. We show that it is competitive with other neural network architectures through empirical evaluations under different random initializations and training validationtest splits of ACE2005 dataset.
