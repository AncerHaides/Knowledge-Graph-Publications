## Improving Large-Scale Fact-Checking using Decomposable Attention Models and Lexical Tagging

**author**:Nayeon Lee,Chien-Sheng Wu,Pascale Fung

**abstract**:Fact-checking of textual sources needs to effectively extract relevant information from large knowledge bases. In this paper, we extend an existing pipeline approach to better tackle this problem. We propose a neural ranker using a decomposable attention model that dynamically selects sentences to achieve
promising improvement in evidence retrieval F1 by 38.80%, with (Ã—65) speedup compared to a TF-IDF method. Moreover, we incorporate lexical tagging methods into our pipeline framework to simplify the tasks and render the model more generalizable. As a result, our
framework achieves promising performance on a large-scale fact extraction and verification dataset with speedup.
