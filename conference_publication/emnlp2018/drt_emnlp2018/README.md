## HyTE: Hyperplane-based Temporally aware Knowledge Graph Embedding

**author**:Shib Sankar Dasgupta, Swayambhu Nath Ray, Partha Talukdar

**abstract**:Knowledge Graph (KG) embedding has
emerged as an active area of research resulting in the development of several KG embedding methods. Relational facts in KG often show temporal dynamics, e.g., the fact (Cristiano Ronaldo, playsFor, Manchester United)
is valid only from 2003 to 2009. Most of the existing KG embedding methods ignore this temporal dimension while learning embeddings of the KG elements. In this paper, we propose HyTE, a temporally aware KG
embedding method which explicitly incorporates time in the entity-relation space by associating each timestamp with a corresponding hyperplane. HyTE not only performs KG inference using temporal guidance, but also predicts temporal scopes for relational facts with missing time annotations. Through extensive experimentation on temporal datasets extracted from real-world KGs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model over both
traditional as well as temporal KG embedding methods.
