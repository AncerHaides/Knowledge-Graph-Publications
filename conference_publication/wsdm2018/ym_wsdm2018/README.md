## Review-Aware Answer Prediction for Product-Related Questions Incorporating Aspects

**author**:Qian Yu,Wai Lam

<<<<<<< HEAD
**abstract**:In E-commerce sites, there are platforms for users to pose product-related questions and experienced customers may provide answers voluntarily. Among the questions asked by users, a large proportion of them are yes-no questions reflecting that users wish to know whether or not the product can satisfy a certain criterion or meet a certain expectation.
Both Question Answering (QA) approaches and Community Question Answering methods are not suitable for answer
prediction for new questions in this setting. The reasons are that questions are product-associated and many of them are concerned about user experiences and subjective opinions. In addition to existing question-answer pairs, user written reviews can provide useful clues for answer prediction. In this paper, we propose a new framework that can tackle the task of review-aware answer prediction for product-related questions. The aspect analytics model in this framework learns latent aspects as well as aspect-specific embeddings
of reviews via a 3-order Autoencoder. One advantage of
this learned model is that it can generate aspect-specific representations for new questions. The predictive answer model in our framework, learned jointly from existing questions, answers, and reviews, is able to predict the answers for new yes-no questions taking into consideration of aspects. Besides, our framework can provide supportive reviews grouped by relevant aspects serving as information for explainable answers. Experiment results on 15 different product categories from a large-scale benchmark E-commence
