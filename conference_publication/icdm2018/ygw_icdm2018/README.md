- **abstract**:  Although many researchers of recommender systems have noted that encoding user-item interactions based on DNNs promotes the performance of collaborative filtering, they ignore that embedding the latent features collected from external sources, e.g., knowledge graphs (KGs), is able to produce more precise recommendation results. Furthermore, CF-based models are still vulnerable to the scenarios of sparse known useritem interactions. In this paper, towards movie recommendation, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced deep recommendation framework incorporating GAN-based models to acquire robust performance. Specifically, our framework first imports various feature embeddings distilled not only from user-movie interactions, but also from KGs and tags, to constitute initial user/movie representations. Then, user/movie representations are fed into a generator and a discriminator simultaneously to learn final optimal representations through adversarial training, which are conducive to generating better recommendation results. The extensive experiments on a real Douban dataset demonstrate our framework’s superiority over some state-of-the-art recommendation models, especially in the scenarios of sparse observed user-movie interactions.
