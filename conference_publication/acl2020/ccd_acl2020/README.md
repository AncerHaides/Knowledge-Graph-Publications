#  Hierarchical Entity Typing via Multi-level Learning to Rank

* **author**: Tongfei Chen, Yunmo Chen, Benjamin Van Durme
* **abstract**: We propose a novel method for hierarchical entity classification that embraces ontological structure at both training and during prediction. At training, our novel multi-level learning-to-rank loss compares positive types against negative siblings according to the type tree. During prediction, we define a coarse-to-fine decoder that restricts viable candidates at each level of the ontology based on already predicted parent type(s). We achieve state-of-the-art across multiple datasets, particularly with respect to strict accuracy.
