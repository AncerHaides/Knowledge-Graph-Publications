# That’s Interesting, Tell Me More! Finding Descriptive Support Passages for Knowledge Graph Relationships
* **author**：Sumit Bhatia, Purusharth Dwivedi, Avneet Kaur
* **abstract**: We address the problem of finding descriptive explanations of facts stored in a knowledge graph. This is important in high-risk domains such as healthcare, intelligence, etc. where users need additional information for decision making and is especially crucial for applications that rely on automatically constructed knowledge graphs where machine-learned systems extract facts from an input corpus and working of the extractors is opaque to the end-user. We follow an approach inspired from information retrieval and propose a simple, yet effective and efficient solution that takes into account passage level as well as document level properties to produce a ranked list of passages describing a given input relation. We test our approach using Wikidata as the knowledge base and Wikipedia as the source corpus and report results of user studies conducted to study the effectiveness of our proposed model.
